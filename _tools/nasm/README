This is a build of NASM for DOS on 32-bit computers.  Nothing older
than a 386 is supported.  Sorry.

              NASM, the Netwide Assembler.

Many many developers all over the net respect NASM for what it is
- a widespread (thus netwide), portable (thus netwide!), very
flexible and mature assembler tool with support for many output
formats (thus netwide!!).
